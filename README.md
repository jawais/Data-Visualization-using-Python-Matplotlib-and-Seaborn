# Data-Visualization-using-Python-Matplotlib-and-Seaborn

In this  project, I tried to understand the fundamentals of data visualization with Python and explore the power of two essential python libraries known as Matplotlib and seaborn. 

In this project I have performed the following tasks:

Task #1: Plot basic Line Plots

Task #2: Plot Scatterplot

Task #3: Plot pie charts

Task #4: Plot Histograms

Task #5: Plot Multiple Plots

Task #6: Plot Subplots

Task #7: Plot 3D Plots

Task #8: Plot Scatterplot & Count plot (Seaborn)

Task #9: Plot Pairplot, Distplot, and Heatmaps (Seaborn)

I have attached the dataset files for this project too.
